## What is this?

This projects consists of free ([libre](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libre)) sticker templates that can easily be tweaked/colored using a web app.

## What's the point of the raffle?

I need some initial testers to make sure the templates fit a veriety of different characters. In the future, the templates will be available to everyone.

## How will winners be decided?

There will be at least 8 winners.
Either I'll choose 50% by hand and 50% randomly, or 100% by hand (not sure yet).

## When will the web app be available?

Soon, I hope. The winners will get their stickers before October 31st, but the application itself will probably take longer to complete (tho an early alpha might be available in the next few weeks).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to do to you what you did to your plushie" Lou said.

Tilting his head and staring at Lou with a confused look, Avoo didn't know what he meant by that.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You'll see" Lou said. He smacked the pink fox's ass before he left the room.

He was gone just a moment. When he came back, the wolf was carrying a giant box.

"He frickin' planned this all along!" Avoo thought. He felt foolish taking the bet.
It looks like one of those plush suits that Avoo and Lou had been talking about.
He was joking about wanting to get one of those at some point.
But he didn't think Lou actually got him one.

With a smile on his face, Lou dropped the box in front of Avoo.

Avoo tried wiggling out of the restraints, but he had no chance.
And with the gag still in, he couldn't object verbally either.
He didn't want to be put in the suit at all.

Lou opened the box, revealing the folded suit.
Unfolded, it measured over 3 meters from head to tail and it had that typical white and orange fox pattern.
He placed it on the floor in front of Avoo, who was still trying to escape his restraints.

Opening the zipper on the back of the giant fox plush revealed its insides.
It was padded with soft fur and mostly hollow.
There also were straps and various other implements to secure and tease the encased victim.

Lou released Avoo's cuffs from the ceiling and forced him onto the floor.
After a few minutes, the fox finally gave up resisting against the wolf's attempts to secure his arms.
He sat on the pink fox's back and first put mittens on his paws and then straps around his arms.
Afterwards, he proceeded with securing the legs in the same way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enjoy the last few minutes of freedom, pup" Lou told the fox.
He let Avoo walk around the room while he prepared the suit.
"And don't make any attempts of escaping. You're going to spend your day in the suit," Lou said. "Or maybe the whole weekend."
